# pwrtx-sagemaker-workshop
Sagemaker workshop on NASA dataset

## Workshop 

### 1. Introduction
Quickly talk about the NASA dataset and run through visualizations used in the paper to set context on what data we have, what constitutes a failure and the data distributions etc.

### 2. Dataset Formulation
Based on what is called out in the paper, we will formulate the dataset with minimal features

### 3. SageMaker Training 
Using dataset from step 3 , we will do 
1. a quick EDA, 
2. do a train validation split 
3. pick a sagemaker algorithm and train a model 
4. Download training report and understand feature importances

### 4. SageMaker Inference

we will use test data to run through SageMaker inference and compare the results to actual values and look at some metrics in the process.
